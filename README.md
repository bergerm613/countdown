# Purim Countdown

Heya! Welcome to my Purim countdown.

### What is Purim

For those of you who don't know - Purim is a Jewish holiday that comes around every year, around late February or early March. It includes: sharing lots of food with family and friend, dressing up in costumes, and celebrating an averted disaster in ancient Persia. All in all, a good time.

([see more about it here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim))

So!

I made a countdown app, to count until Purim comes around again.

### Technical Deets

This is a React application, written in Typescript.

It will count down the seconds until Purim starts. Which, like all Jewish days, begins on sunset of the previous evening. To get the exact time of sunset, I'm using the [Hebcal API](https://www.hebcal.com/home/1663/zmanim-halachic-times-api).

I hope you'll find the code to be thoughtfully written, clearly organized, and well documented.
